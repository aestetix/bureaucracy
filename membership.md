The following rights are afforded to members in good standing. If a member is delinquent, they are not entitled to these rights.

1. A member is entitled to participate in membership meetings.
2. A member is entitled to participate in election of the board.
3. A member is entitled to be at Noisebridge at any time, to have the means to obtain entry to Noisebridge, and to bring guests to Noisebridge and to host them there while the member is also present.
4. A member is entitled to access the list of all persons who are members.


Responsibilities
